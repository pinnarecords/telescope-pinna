They have been performed on a variety of instruments, including the traditional Japanese koto and shō, in both solo and ensemble settings, but until now, no solo piano recording has been available outside Japan.</p><p>This set, featuring the \"unabashedly gorgeous\" The Olive Branch Speaks, commissioned by the pianist for her A Sweeter Music project, is lavishly packaged and is accompanied by essays from both the composer and performer.</p><p>Patterns of Plants is now available for preorder.</p>"
